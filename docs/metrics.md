# Metrics

## Process metrics

The following metrics are generated for captured process groups, as well as for the processes in a cgroup.

In this table, the default namespace, `process` is used. If you specify a different namespace in the configuration, the metrics will be prefixed with that namespace. For cgroups, the namespace is `cgroup`.
